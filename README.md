# Lagoa Dataset

For our experiments, we developed a new dataset named **Lagoa**.  
It includes data collected from cyclists who completed laps around the Pampulha Lagoon in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.  

The dataset is structured as a dictionary:  
- **Key** → the cyclist’s unique ID.  
- **Value** → a matrix with route information. Each row corresponds to one observation.  

The recorded variables include:  
- Time  
- Heart rate  
- Smoothed velocity  
- Grade smooth  
- Power output (watts)  
- Distance  
- Other signals (excluded from our analysis due to being available only for a small subset of riders).  

The data collection took place between **January and July 2024**.  
In total, the dataset covers **126 cyclists**, accounting for **1014 rides**.  
Most participants completed multiple laps around the lagoon, which makes the dataset particularly rich for analyzing repeated patterns.
